# JovarkOS Link Shortener

## Purpose
Multi-purpose, simple link shortener

## How it works
Fill out the form. It's that simple.


If you really care, it creates a new directory with the name of a user inputted string. Inside, it creates an `index.php` file with `header("Location: $url");` in it to do a redirect to the submitted url.

Simple, huh?

### Notes
To change where a short link goes to, resubmit the form with the new url with the same name.
